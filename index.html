    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>On this website, I have used Figma and Visual Studio to create a website that reflects my interests and skills. Designing a website can be an exciting process, but it can also be challenging. In my experience, the most important thing is to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve with the website. Is it for a company? Is it for a personal blog? Is it for an online store? Once you have a clear idea, you can start working on the design.</p>
    <p>The design of a website involves many different elements, such as choosing colors, fonts, images, and organizing content. It's important to keep in mind that the design should be attractive and easy to use for visitors to the website. It's also important to make sure that the website is easy to navigate and that information is easy to find.</p>
<p>However, designing a website can also present many challenges. For example, it can be difficult to find the right balance between an attractive design and a functional design. It can also be difficult to make sure that the website looks good on different devices and browsers.</p>
    <p>If you need technology images for your website, I suggest you look for them on free image websites such as Pexels or Unsplash. These sites offer a wide variety of high-quality images that you can use on your website. Make sure to choose an image that fits the theme of your website and is of high quality.</p>
