This is the Readme.md file of my practical work and Im going to explain how i starteed focusing my work and how i did it finally.

First when i got asigned to do this job i did like Oliver told us and started to o a template in sigma but at one point i realized that after having the designt there it was going to take me a lot of time to move it into a Visual Studio file judt becuase of how figma works so i tried using somo plug in to make it faster but nothign really worked so i passed the figma work that i had adn then started to look for other templates to use and change things on them to addapt the to my website and the thinks asked on it.

Then it was creating all the files and links, fist when i tried to link my webs with the css it only worked  if it was outside de folder but then i fouund out how to do it and the same with the jtml files and linking them in the menu that i designed. Then basic problems with the divs or some missing display felexes that are easy to solve but you dont realize some times.

Then for the topic i decided some thing that i liked and look for it and got helped by a bit of ai in the text but nothing else and the contacto form was proably the easiest to do finding a template and chaanging some stuff.


My conclusion are that designing a web by code is way harder than by usign those template apps but you understang the strucutre of them and how they are created which is usefull to desun your own projects.
